      <description>If every model in this model’s unit has this rule, it can be deployed anywhere that is at least 9” away from enemy units at the end of Deployment (after both players have Deployed).

      <alias>Psychic Tests</alias>
      <description>To cast a Psychic Power, select a model to cast and a target unit. Make a Leadership Test using the unmodified Leadership value of the model casting the power.

If the test is passed, the Psychic Power is successfully cast. If the test is failed, the Psychic Power is not successfully cast. In addition, if a natural 2 was rolled, roll another D6 and consult the Warp Effects table.

1      -   The caster is slain
2      -   The caster takes 1 Mortal Wound and cannot cast any more Psychic Powers this phase
3      -   The caster cannot cast any more Psychic Powers this phase
4-6   -   No effect

Note that Psychic Powers which target a unit (friend or enemy) require Line of Sight and are affected by terrain. They can target friendly units which are in Engaged, but cannot target enemy units if either the target or the casting unit are Engaged (unless otherwise specified). A unit’s characteristics (including movement distance) can only ever be affected by the same Psychic Power once, even though it can be targeted (and damaged) by the same Psychic Power multiple times.


If it chooses to cast the same power multiple times within a round, it is subject to the following rules:
- For each subsequent cast of the power, roll an additional d6, taking the lowest result
- For each subsequent cast of the power, subtract 1 to the Warp Effects table
- If the power fails to be cast, it cannot be cast again in that round</description>

      <description>Restrictions: Cannot be your first turn. Must be in reserves.


A unit that is currently held in reserve may move onto the battlefield from any point on the edge of the board which is within the owning player’s deployment zone. Each model in the unit moves as though disembarking from that point (place the model in base contact with the point, move it, and ensure it does not end more than 6” away from that point).


If all models in a unit have the Infiltrate special rule, then they may instead arrive from any point on the edge of the board that is outside of the opposing player’s deployment zone.


If all models in the unit have the Deep Strike special rule, then they may instead be placed anywhere on the battlefield where they would be able to move to (ie. not on impassible terrain, not in base contact with other models, etc.) but all models must be in base contact with each other (or as close as possible).


Regardless of how the unit moves onto the battlefield, all models must end outside of 6” of any enemy models. 


Units which arrive in this fashion may not run.</description>

A unit which is currently embarked in a transport can disembark by placing each model on the battlefield in base contact with the transport, and then moving them as per a standard move. However, they cannot end more than 6” away from the transport.</description>

All models in the unit immediately move their full movement distance directly away from the centre of mass of all engaged enemy units. They must move in a straight line unless another unit or obstacle blocks their path, in which case they take the shortest path around them. Models may only move less than their full movement if they must do so in order to remain in coherency. If the unit cannot end its move outside of base contact with all enemy units, then it cannot Fall Back.


The unit then immediately becomes Broken.</description>

Engaged models:
- They must take a Fall Back move to leave engagement range
- Infantry and Mounted can only shoot Pistol weapons
- Walkers cannot shoot Heavy weapons
- Cannot shoot at or be shot by units other than those they are engaged with
- Cannot shoot with or be shot by Blast weapons


Tank and Titanic models never count towards units being engaged for the purpose of the above restrictions. ie.
* Tank/Titanic models can always freely shoot and be shot at
* Enemy units in base contact with only Tank/Titanic models can move freely and can shoot and be shot at
* Tank/Titanic models still attack and can be attacked in the Combat phase if in base contact with enemy units</description>

      <description>An Involuntary Fall Back move counts as a Fall Back move, but it has additional restrictions on how the unit moves. The unit must move move up to its full Movement value, stopping only if:


There is Impassable terrain it cannot move around (it must end in base contact with this terrain)
There are friendly units it cannot move around (it must end 1” away from these units) - note that Infantry units can still move through friendly Infantry units, as long as they end 1” away from each other
There are enemy units that it cannot move around (it must end outside of Combat with these units)


If this movement is caused by a Break Test, the unit must attempt to end its move as far away from all units that damaged it in this Phase. Otherwise, it must move as directly as possible toward the closest point on its board edge.


If this movement takes the unit into contact with the edge of the board, then it is destroyed.</description>

    <rule name="Coherency" id="a764-8ce9-c64f-29b7" hidden="false">
      <description>Warhammer is a game of units, and units are made up of 1 or more individual models. Whenever there is more than one model in a unit, it must maintain Coherency with other models in its unit. This means it must be within 2” of at least one other model in the unit (ie. the widest gap between bases of the two models is no more than 2”). For every 10 additional models in the unit, the number of models within 2” required to maintain coherency increases by 1. For example:
1 model:            No coherency required
2 - 10 models:   Within 2” of at least 1 other model
11-20 models:   Within 2” of at least 2 other models
21-30 models:   Within 2” of at least 3 other models


Models in a unit can never voluntarily move outside of coherency with their unit. Models in a unit can never voluntarily be removed if it would break coherency of their unit. If a model is forced to be moved or removed in such a way that it would break coherency, the unit is immediately Broken and must take an Involuntary Fall Back move.</description>
